---------------------------------


================
* New Features *
================

	- Documentation :
		Added column "Reason" for documentation purpose in tables :
			* DatabaseRoles
			* DatabaseRoleMembers
			* DatabasePermissions

			* onschemaprivs
			* onobjectprivs
			* CustomRoles
			* CustomRoleMembers
	
	- Flexibility :
        - Added parameter for setting separator in standard role naming convention :
            it was previously : <SCHEMA_NAME>_<ROLE_NAME>
            it's now          : <SCHEMA_NAME><SEPARATOR><ROLE_NAME>
                                The name of the parameter is Separator4OnSchemaStandardRole
                                
        -   added field "permissionlevel" in tables "standardonschemarolessecurity" 
            and "onobjectprivs"

            values / effect on user   / effect on role
            ------   ---------------    --------------
            revoke /  	revoke 		  / remove membership
            grant  /  	grant  		  / add membership
            deny   / 	deny   		  / !! n/a !! 

            at this time, this field is not used for generation.		

================
* Core Changes *
================
	- Added table "DatabaseRoles" which will be the replacement table for
	  CustomRoles table and which will also contain a generated list of
	  standard database roles.
  
	- Added table "StandardExclusion". 
		It's in this table that exception to the defined standard will come.
		At the moment, just 2 available exclusions :
			* DATABASE
			* DATABASE_SCHEMA
		Data provided by this table is taken in account by procedure for standard T-SQL generation.  

	- Added standard role "prog_executors" which is below "end users"
	  and only has EXECUTE permission on schemas.
